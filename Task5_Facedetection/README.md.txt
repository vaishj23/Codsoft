# Task 5 - Face Detection

This project implements a real-time face detection system using OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifier.

## Description
The application detects human faces from a webcam feed and draws bounding boxes around detected faces.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Haar Cascade Classifier

## How to Run
1. Install OpenCV:
   python -m pip install opencv-python

2. Run the program:
   python face_detection.py

3. Press 'q' to exit the webcam window.

## Output
Faces are detected in real-time and highlighted with rectangles.
